# hacknight1

## Format

- We’ll start with a warm up round for 15 minutes to let teams coordinate and learn a bit about tonight’s secret ingredient. 
- We’ll then enter Stage 1 for 60 minutes, where teams can start on the most important features for tonight’s hackathon. 
- At the end of Stage 1, we’ll make an announcement about Stage 2’s secret ingredient and turn you loose. 
  - Teams can continue work on Stage 1 throughout Stage 2, as it’s weighted higher on the grading. 
  - A working POC with both stages is a tall order but will be heavily favored. 
- We’ll do demos and judging. All code must be PR’d to the team’s open source Repository on GitHub at the time of judgement – because sharing is caring.  

## Warm Up (15 mins)

### Summary
We’re going to work with Twilio tonight, so go get free credit by doing the Twilio Quest Getting Started and earning $20. It’s super quick and easy, and you’ll be able to use the free credit to win cash tonight. 

We’ll also provide $25 AWS credit, so you can open an account there as needed. You might end up needing it, especially for Stage 2, so now would be a good time to register a fresh account (if you don’t want to muddy up your personal one)
